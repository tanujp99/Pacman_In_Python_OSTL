# Pacman_In_Python_OSTL
#### *Game based on open-source technology*

#### This project aims to re-create the age-old classic arcade game in Python language. Pac-Man, a single-player arcade maze-chase video game. In the game, a yellow, circular character navigates a maze, eating pellets and fruit, avoiding ghosts and occasionally eating them.  The player controls the titular character through an enclosed maze; the objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four ghosts. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost.
